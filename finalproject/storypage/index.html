    <div> <p class="bodytext">Bonfrida Kakwaya is initially hesitant to tell her story. She averts her eyes, and fidgets with the sleeve of her sweater.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">"My English isn’t good," she says.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">After some gentle encouragement, however, Kakwaya begins to speak.</p>


    <p class="bodytext">She came to the United States in December of 2008, accompanied by her four young children. Kakwaya is from the Congo, a region that has historically been plagued by violence. Now a mother of seven, Kakwaya sought to safeguard her children, and sought refuge to offer them a better life.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">Upon her arrival, new threats came not from outside, but from within her own home.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">Lead poisoning is an issue long thought to have been eradicated. In 1971, after research proved that inhalation of lead led to severe side effects in both children and adults, lead paint was officially banned in the United States. However, older homes often still have lead paint underneath top coats that cover it. When the top coat fades away, the risk of lead poisoning becomes more likely.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">Lead poisoning is an issue long thought to have been eradicated. In 1971, after research proved that inhalation of the flaking paint led to severe side effects in both children and adults. lead paint was officially banned in the United States. However, older homes often still have lead paint underneath top coats that cover it. When the top coat fades away, the risk of lead poisoning becomes more likely.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">Most of the homes in Syracuse were built in the early 1900s, with over 90% of the housing stock built before 1978. Open data records show almost all of the lead violations in the city were due to the presence of uncovered lead paint. When Kakwaya arrived in Syracuse, her family settled in one such house in East Syracuse.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">"Before I came here, I didn’t know that the houses here could be a situation, I thought maybe the house was good,” she said. “I didn’t know that there was lead in the house." 

    <p class="bodytext">Last year, Kakwaya’s young daughter was diagnosed with high-grade lead poisoning.</p>

    <p class="bodytext"> "She’s breathing," Kakwaya said. "But her brain is affected." </p>

    <p class="bodytext">Her daughter now struggles with concentration, with her mental and physical development potentially impaired. Many children who are affected by lead poisoning exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity, irritability, hearing loss, and loss of focus. The effects, which harm the child’s cognitive abilities, are permanent. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">Paul Ciavarri, a community organizer for Legal Services of Central New York, says the lead problem in Syracuse potentially costs the city hundreds of IQ points. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">"The city isn’t doing itself any favors intelligence-wise," Ciavarri said. "We have one parent who was in a house where her child was lead poisoned at 15 to 20 micrograms per deciliter," which is incredibly severe. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">The boy in question had to be taken to Upstate Medical Hospital twice for chelation therapy, where doctors attempted to lower his lead levels via an IV. However, they struggled to remove the lead from his system. While he is no longer hospitalized, the damage the lead had done still affects him and his family. </p>

    <p class="bodytext"> "Now, the young boy is so hyperactive that schools won’t accept him," Ciavarri said.</p>

    <iframe class="graphic2" title="Lead Violation Counts by Neighborhood in Syracuse, NY" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ZcEN2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZcEN2/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="682"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>


    <p class="bodytext">While lead poisoning is a city-wide issue, some neighborhoods are more affected than others. In the charts above, lead code violations are mapped by neighborhoods in Syracuse. There is a significant disparity between the western and eastern halves of the city. The west, which has a large minority population, has significantly more violations than its eastern counterpart, which is occupied by Syracuse University students. 

    <p class="pullquote">"I thought maybe the house was good." - Bonfrida Kakwaya

    <p class="bodytext">Ciavarri and Kakwaya estimated the childhood lead poisoning numbers as a result of lead violations range between 500 to 600 cases per year. Recent <a href="http://www.ongov.net/health/lead/data.html">data</a> shows a decrease in cases, but it coincides with a decrease in testing, significantly hindering efforts to analyze the full scope of the lead poisoning issue. In addition, lead care machines, which would allow pediatricians to test children in-office, have been on backorder during the pandemic, Ciavarri said.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">To make their voices heard, affected families in Syracuse have created “Families for Lead Freedom Now,” a grassroots organization dedicated to raising awareness about childhood lead poisoning in the city. Recently, the group was able to push the city to pass an official Lead Ordinance. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">"For the sake of our children, and the well-being of all children in Syracuse, we urge adoption of these (or very similar) changes in order to make the Syracuse Lead Ordinance a viable and practical tool that can effectively and significantly reduce the annual cases of childhood lead poisoning in the City of Syracuse," the Ordinance said. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">Officials outside of Syracuse have begun to take notice. Letitia James, Attorney General of New York, recently filed a lawsuit against EndZone Properties, alleging the company had not properly maintained houses with lead paint, resulting in the lead poisoning of children. </p>

    <p class="bodytext"> "If it’s a rental [property], then the health department will help the tenant communicate with the landlord about the hazards and then will give them a certain amount of time to fix them. Landlords can also be fined for not repairing such hazards," said Elizabeth Amond, who works for the Central/Eastern New York Lead Poisoning Resource Center. Jennifer Forward, author of the 2020 paper "The Numbers Beneath the Paint," analyzed homes with chipped lead paint in Syracuse. She found that there were more instances of chipped paint in homes owned by landlords than those that were owned by the resident.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">If James is able to win the lawsuit, more landlords could be similarly sued, Ciavarri said. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">Despite the work she has done, Kakwaya is angered by the government. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">"[Government officals have] been here for years and years and years, and they know about [lead]" she said. "I think some of the questions you have you should ask America. Not me, who just came. I’m not here to educate Americans about lead."

    <p class="bodytext">As more eyes turn to Syracuse, Kakwaya remains vigilant. Protecting her children, she says, is what’s important.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">"I’m still fighting."</p> </div>
